## Features
* **Implied Volatility Analysis:** Regime analysis and forward vs. current iVOL tracking.

## 🛠 Future Roadmap
* **Hidden Markov Models (HMM):** Implementing HMMs to better model regime shifts in latent space, allowing for more robust detection of transitions between high and low volatility states, which can influence strategy decision-making
